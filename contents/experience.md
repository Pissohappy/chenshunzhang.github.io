### 🔬 Undergraduate Thesis: Semantic-Level Efficient Retrieval of Key Technical Points in Massive Patent Data

**Dec 2024 – May 2025**

* Proposed a semantic-enhanced retrieval framework integrating component-function extraction, contrastive learning, and dual-tower encoders.
* Built a large-scale claim-description matching dataset with a three-stage retrieval model (TF-IDF, Sentence-BERT, structure-aware re-ranker).
* Validated effectiveness on CNIPA patent examination datasets with improved Recall\@K and interpretability.
* Final Thesis: *Research on Semantic-Level Efficient Retrieval Methods for Key Technical Points in Large-Scale Patent Data* (Advisor: Prof. Xianling Mao).
